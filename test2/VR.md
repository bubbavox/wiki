### Daniel's tips:

- The 65GB version is big enough for personal use if you always uninstall games you don't plan on playing anytime soon. If you want to store movies or every game then an extra $100 for the 256GB is worth it.

- Walmart has the best protection plan I found - https://www.walmart.com/ip/Oculus-Quest-2-Advanced-All-In-One-Virtual-Reality-Headset-256-GB/949146211

- There are several accessories that are must haves and take multiple weeks for delivery so should be ordered right away.

  - Back head strap is a must have. Three examples (The first link is head strap only. The last two links come with extras.
  A.1: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001618940665.html
  A.2: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NT8QQP7/
  A.3: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QZGNHVH/

  - A face mask is also a must have. There are two types - cheap silicone and more expensive memory foam with PU leather. Both types are good. The 2 kits above come with a silicone mask.
  B.1: Use a kit above.
  B.2: Silicone mask - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001874634807.html
  B.3: PU Leather mask - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QFD7CYR/

  - Microfiber cleaning cloths for the lenses - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XBQ8FV7/

  - Rechargeable AA batteries for the grips - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089GKLQQJ/

  - Sweatbands. Sounds silly but is actually really helpful - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M2F6CC6/

  - Silicone grips. Not as important as the above but they are cheap and a bit nicer than nothing at all. They are included with the kits above and with the silicone mask above. If you don't get any of those then you can search for something like "oculus quest 2 grips for controllers".
   
  - To play in the dark or use it as night vision you have to have something like this - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075ZYG89D/

  - For motion sickness these are cheap but probably not much more than just a placebo - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HHQQ1QJ/

  - If you got the halo strap above and want a case then this one should fit - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001666795484.html

- There are some settings and software you need that I can show you after you get it.

- Virtual Desktop is fairly important and $20. Population: One is probably the only game you will want to pay for. $20.
