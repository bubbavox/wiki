[Calibrating a torque wrench](http://www.instructables.com/id/Fixing-and-Calibrating-a-Clicky-style-Torque-Wrenc)
[Precision Instruments](http://www.torqwrench.com/) have a good reputation for their split beam torque wrenches.
I use Tekton click micrometer torque wrenches, in 1/4" & 3/8"... someday I'll buy the Precision Instruments 1/2".

#### Anti-Sieze, etc
