# VIRTUAL REALITY!

----------------

## Oculus Quest 2

### Daniel's tips:


- The 65GB version is big enough for personal use if you always uninstall games you don't plan on playing anytime soon. If you want to store movies or every game then an extra $100 for the 256GB is worth it.

- Walmart has the best protection plan I found - https://www.walmart.com/ip/Oculus-Quest-2-Advanced-All-In-One-Virtual-Reality-Headset-256-GB/949146211

- There are several accessories that are must haves and take multiple weeks for delivery so should be ordered right away.

  - Back head strap is a must have. Three examples (The first link is head strap only. The last two links come with extras.

  - A face mask is also a must have. There are two types - cheap silicone and more expensive memory foam with PU leather. Both types are good. The 2 kits above come with a silicone mask.

  - Silicone grips. Not as important as the above but they are cheap and a bit nicer than nothing at all. They are included with the kits above and with the silicone mask above. If you don't get any of those then you can search for something like "oculus quest 2 grips for controllers".
   
  - To play in the dark or use it as night vision you have to have something like this - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075ZYG89D/

  - If you got the halo strap above and want a case then this one should fit - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001666795484.html
